#Coltan

Coltan is a collection of useful elements for building applications with the Appcelerator Titanium Mobile framework, including:

- Modifications for [Backbone.js](http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/) that alter the `View` prototype to work with Titanium UI elements
- Titanium-specific mixins for [Underscore.js](http://documentcloud.github.com/underscore/)
- An HTTP API client class
- A Google Maps API client (for better reverse geo-coding, specifically)
- A `WebMapView`, for providing access to the full features of the Google Maps JavaScript API (particularly useful as an alternative for dealing with the native maps on Android)
- Some useful UI elements
 - HUD-style activity indicator for iOS and small window messages (lifted from the KitchenSink demo app)
 - A few custom buttons
- A value inspector (adapted from [Node.js's](http://nodejs.org/) `util` module)

Documentation, tests, and demo application to come.
